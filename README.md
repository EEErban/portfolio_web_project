# portfolio web project

Welcome to my portfolio website, this will be my personal space to showcase work and projects 

## Description

This was a task to create a detailed portfolio using HTML & CSS, that would show good general practice.

Key points was to show:
* a descriptive title
* navigation bar
* automatic scrolling to sections
* titled images for projects
* clickable links to appropriate repo
